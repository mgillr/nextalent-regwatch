EXECUTIVE SUMMARY CVSS v4 8.5 ATTENTION : Low attack complexity Vendor : Delta Electronics Equipment : CNCSoft-G2 Vulnerability : Out-of-bounds Write 2. RISK EVALUATION Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of the device. 3. TECHNICAL DETAILS 3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS The following versions of Delta Electronics CNCSoft-G2 are affected: CNCSoft-G2: Version 2.1.0.20 and prior 3.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW 3.2.1 OUT-OF-BOUNDS WRITE CWE-787 Delta Electronics CNCSoft-G2 is vulnerable to a flaw in the parsing of DPAX files that allows attackers to execute arbitrary code. This vulnerability requires user interaction, such as visiting a malicious page or opening a malicious file. Exploitation of this flaw can result in memory corruption and code execution within the context of the current process. CVE-2025-47728 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3.1 base score of 7.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ( AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H ). A CVSS v4 score has also been calculated for CVE-2025-47728 . A base score of 8.5 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ( AV:L/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:P/VC:H/VI:H/VA:H/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N ). 3.3 BACKGROUND CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS: Critical Manufacturing, Energy COUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED: Worldwide COMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION: Taiwan 3.4 RESEARCHER Natnael Samson (@NattiSamson) working with Trend Micro Zero Day Initiative reported this vulnerability to CISA. 4. MITIGATIONS Delta Electronics recommends users update to v2.1.0.27 or later. Delta has published Delta-PCSA-2025-00007 in both English and Chinese on their security website to provide more details about these issues. Delta also recommends the following general security practices: Do not click on untrusted Internet links or open unsolicited attachments in emails. Avoid exposing control systems and equipment to the Internet. Place systems and devices behind a firewall and isolate them from the business network. When remote access is required, use a secure access method, such as a virtual private network (VPN). If you have any product-related support concerns, find a contact from Delta's portal page for any information or materials you may require. CISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures. CISA also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS webpage on cisa.gov/ics . Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies . CISA encourages organizations to implement recommended cybersecurity strategies for proactive defense of ICS assets . Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at cisa.gov/ics in the technical information paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies . Organizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents. CISA also recommends users take the following measures to protect themselves from social engineering attacks: Refer to Recognizing and Avoiding Email Scams for more information on avoiding email scams. Refer to Avoiding Social Engineering and Phishing Attacks for more information on social engineering attacks. No known public exploitation specifically targeting this vulnerability has been reported to CISA at this time. This vulnerability is not exploitable remotely. 5.
