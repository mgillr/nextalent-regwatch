        "summary": "CISA, in collaboration with NSA and 19 international partners, released joint guidance outlining A Shared Vision of Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) for Cybersecurity . This marks a significant step forward in strengthening software supply chain transparency and security worldwide. An SBOM is a formal record detailing the components and supply chain relationships used in building software. SBOMs act as a software “ingredients list” providing organizations with essential visibility into software dependencies, enabling them to identify components, assess risks, and take proactive measures to mitigate vulnerabilities. The guidance highlights the benefits of SBOM adoption for software producers, purchasers, operators, and national security organizations. Key advantages include reducing risks, improving vulnerability management, and enhancing overall software security practices. By promoting transparency, aligning technical approaches, and leveraging automation, SBOM adoption strengthens the resilience of the global software ecosystem. This guidance urges organizations worldwide to integrate SBOM practices into their security frameworks to collaboratively address supply chain risks and enhance cybersecurity resilience. For more information on SBOM, visit: https://www.cisa.gov/sbom . For leadership statements from co-authoring organizations, visit: Statements of Support on A Shared Vision of SBOM for Cybersecurity .",

Binding Operational Directive (BOD) 22-01: Reducing the Significant Risk of Known Exploited Vulnerabilities established the KEV Catalog as a living list of known Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) that carry significant risk to the federal enterprise. BOD 22-01 requires Federal Civilian Executive Branch (FCEB) agencies to remediate identified vulnerabilities by the due date to protect FCEB networks against active threats. See the BOD 22-01 Fact Sheet for more information. Although BOD 22-01 only applies to FCEB agencies, CISA strongly urges all organizations to reduce their exposure to cyberattacks by prioritizing timely remediation of KEV Catalog vulnerabilities as part of their vulnerability management practice. CISA will continue to add vulnerabilities to the catalog that meet the specified criteria .",
